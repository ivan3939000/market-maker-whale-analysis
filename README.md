# Market Maker & Whale Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a research project focused on analyzing
the behavior of large market participants (whales and market makers)
in cryptocurrency markets using MetaTrader 5 tools.

The project is designed for market structure research
and does not provide trading or investment recommendations.

---

## Research Goal
The main goal of this project is to identify moments
when one side of the market gains dominance
and to determine the probable direction of price movement
based on structural market behavior.

---

## Core Concept
Market price movements are not random.
Large participants operate through phases such as:
- accumulation
- distribution
- impulse execution

This project attempts to formalize these phases
and separate structural movements from market noise.

---

## What the System Does
- Analyzes price structure and market phases
- Detects zones of interest of large participants
- Identifies directional bias based on structure
- Filters non-structural price movements

---

## Practical Observations
During practical usage, the system demonstrated
stable directional detection on cryptocurrency instruments.

Observed results were confirmed through:
- manual price behavior analysis
- structural comparison of market phases
- repeated occurrence of similar market situations

Graphical examples and screenshots
will be added after further systematization.

---

## Current Status
- The MT5-based system is under active development
- Core logic is stable and being refined
- An additional analytical script is in progress

---

## Development Roadmap
- Statistical evaluation of detected directions
- External cloud-based data analysis
- Improved market phase filtering
- Extended structural pattern classification.  

---

## Important Notice
This project is strictly research-oriented.
It is not a trading system and does not provide
financial or investment advice.## Proof of Concept

The system described in this repository has been tested
on real market data.

Practical confirmations exist in the form of:
- historical market observations
- real-time behavior consistency
- experimental results

Detailed examples and additional materials
can be provided upon request.
